    <p>
      An |ExpressionStatement| cannot start with a U+007B (LEFT CURLY BRACKET) because that might make it ambiguous with a |Block|.
      An |ExpressionStatement| cannot start with the `function` or `class` keywords because that would make it ambiguous with a |FunctionDeclaration|, a |GeneratorDeclaration|, or a |ClassDeclaration|.
      An |ExpressionStatement| cannot start with `async function` because that would make it ambiguous with an |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|.
      An |ExpressionStatement| cannot start with the two token sequence `let [` because that would make it ambiguous with a `let` |LexicalDeclaration| whose first |LexicalBinding| was an |ArrayBindingPattern|.
      <ins>An |ExpressionStatement| cannot start with `throw` because that would make it ambiguous with a `ThrowStatement`.</ins>
